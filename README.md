# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and deploying a machine learning model that classifies whether a person has breast cancer based on medical data. The model uses a RandomForest Classifier to perform binary classification (presence or absence of breast cancer). A Flask application has been developed to enable deployment of the model as a web service.

Objectives
Develop a binary classification model for breast cancer detection.
Deploy the model using Flask, allowing easy access to model predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
Machine Learning: RandomForest Classifier for binary classification
Flask: Framework for deploying the model as a web service
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn: Model development and evaluation
